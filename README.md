# retro-assembly
This repository contains my random assembly programs for retrocomputers.

**bresenham_demo.asm**  for [Commodore Plus/4](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/Commodore_Plus/4) draws lines with the [Bresenham algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm) from the cursor position (movable by joystick in port 1) to the screen corners. The prg-file contains the compiled program, run from BASIC with command "SYS 5120".
